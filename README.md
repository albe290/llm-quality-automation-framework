# LLM Quality Automation Framework

A Python-based framework for **automated quality, safety, and reliability evaluation of LLMs and agentic AI systems**.

This project demonstrates how to transform probabilistic AI behavior into **testable, enforceable contracts** that can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, security workflows, and governance programs.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

Modern organizations deploying LLMs and autonomous agents face a core challenge:

> **AI behavior is difficult to define, test, trust, and enforce at scale.**

Traditional QA processes break down when applied to probabilistic systems, leading to:
- Manual prompt testing
- Inconsistent quality standards
- Unclear release gates
- Elevated security and governance risk

This framework was built to address those gaps directly.

## 🧠 How This Framework Solves AI Quality Automation Pain Points

### 🔥 Pain Point: AI Quality Is Subjective and Undefined

**Problem**  
Teams often rely on human judgment to decide whether an AI response is “good enough,” leading to inconsistent standards and unclear ownership.

**Solution**  
This framework introduces **machine-enforceable test contracts** using JSON Schema.  
Each test explicitly defines:
- Expected behavior
- Forbidden behavior
- Failure severity

AI quality becomes a **shared, enforceable definition**, not an opinion.

---

### 🔥 Pain Point: AI Testing Does Not Scale

**Problem**  
Ad-hoc scripts and manual reviews cannot keep up with rapid model iteration or CI/CD pipelines.

**Solution**  
Test cases are:
- Declarative
- Schema-validated
- Automatically executed by a test runner

This enables:
- Repeatable execution
- Deterministic evaluation
- CI/CD integration

AI testing becomes **automation-first and production-ready**.

---

### 🔥 Pain Point: Security Risks Are Known but Rarely Enforced

**Problem**  
Threats such as prompt injection, instruction override, and refusal failures are discussed but not continuously tested.

**Solution**  
Security risks are encoded as **first-class test cases** with explicit forbidden behaviors and severity levels.  
These tests run on every execution, turning AI security into an **executable control**, not a policy document.

---

### 🔥 Pain Point: Teams Don’t Know When to Block a Release

**Problem**  
AI failures are often discovered after deployment because all issues are treated equally or ignored due to noise.

**Solution**  
Each test includes a severity level (low → critical), enabling pipelines to:
- Block releases on high-risk failures
- Log lower-risk issues for review
- Align technical decisions with business risk

AI quality enforcement becomes **intentional and risk-based**.

---

### 🔥 Pain Point: Lack of Observability and Auditability

**Problem**  
AI behavior changes over time, but teams lack artifacts to explain or audit those changes.

**Solution**  
Test execution produces structured, machine-readable results that can be:
- Logged
- Visualized
- Audited
- Ingested by governance platforms

This establishes a foundation for **AI observability, compliance, and executive reporting**.

---

## 🧪 Framework Capabilities

- JSON-based test case definitions
- JSON Schema validation for test contracts
- Modular LLM runner abstraction
- Custom evaluators (e.g., refusal detection, behavior validation)
- Deterministic pass/fail evaluation
- CI/CD-ready execution model

---

## 🤖 Agentic AI Validation (Beyond Prompt Testing)

To prove this framework works beyond static prompt evaluation, it is validated against a **live agentic AI system**.

The framework is used to evaluate an autonomous **Snake AI agent** against deterministic behavioral success criteria, including:

- Survival state (`alive`)
- Minimum execution thresholds (`ticks_executed`)
- Performance benchmarks (`snake_length`)

These tests validate **agent behavior inside a running system**, not just isolated text outputs.

This mirrors real enterprise scenarios where AI agents must meet operational guarantees such as reliability, safety, and performance — not just generate plausible responses.

---

## 🔗 SentinelForge AI Integration (Closed-Loop Governance)

This framework is designed to integrate with **SentinelForge AI** as a validation and enforcement layer.

- SentinelForge AI identifies AI risks and required controls
- This framework validates those controls against live model or agent behavior
- Results can be fed back into SentinelForge for:
  - Risk scoring
  - SLA enforcement
  - Executive summaries
  - Governance reporting

Together, they enable a closed-loop system:

> **Detect → Test → Enforce → Explain**

## 💼 Resume-Ready Project Highlights (Job-Aligned Capabilities)

This project was intentionally designed and implemented to reflect the real-world responsibilities of AI quality, evaluation, and agent reliability roles.

### LLM Quality Automation Framework

- Built a **Python-based AI quality automation framework** that converts probabilistic LLM and agent behavior into **machine-enforceable test contracts** using JSON Schema.

- Implemented a **declarative test execution engine** that evaluates AI outputs against expected and forbidden behaviors, enabling **deterministic pass/fail validation** suitable for CI/CD pipelines.

- Designed **modular evaluation components** (LLM runners, security evaluators, behavior validators) with clear separation of concerns to support scalability and reuse across models and systems.

- Encoded AI safety and security risks (e.g., refusal failures, instruction override, prompt injection patterns) as **first-class automated tests**, transforming policy requirements into **executable controls**.

- Introduced **risk-based severity gating** (low → critical) to support automated release decisions and prevent deployment of high-risk AI behavior.

- Generated **structured, machine-readable evaluation artifacts** to support AI observability, auditability, and long-term governance.

### Agentic AI Behavioral Validation (Snake AI)

- Applied the framework to a **live autonomous agent system**, validating AI behavior within a running environment rather than isolated prompt outputs.

- Defined **deterministic behavioral success criteria** for an AI agent, including survival state, minimum execution thresholds, and performance benchmarks.

- Built automated agent tests to detect **early termination, stalled execution, and performance degradation**, enabling repeatable regression testing of agent logic.

- Demonstrated how AI quality tooling can validate **operational guarantees** such as reliability, safety, and performance required for production-grade agentic systems.

### Engineering & Architecture Principles

- Applied **automation-first design** to AI evaluation workflows, eliminating reliance on manual review and enabling repeatable execution.

- Leveraged schema validation and structured outputs to ensure **consistency, reliability, and audit-readiness** across test runs.

- Designed the framework to integrate with **AI governance and risk platforms**, enabling closed-loop workflows for detection, validation, enforcement, and reporting.
